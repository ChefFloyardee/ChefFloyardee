		<p>I lived in what is now called our "old house" until the age of 5, and we moved to our "new house" right before I was slated to start SCHOOL!</a></p>
		<center><h2>Starting School</a></h2></center>
		<p>My Elementary School was K-6, and the seven years I spent there were some of the best!</a></p>

		<center><h2>Moving Up to High School</a></h2></center>
		<p>After Elementary School I entered a Jr/Sr High School for grades 7-12, and things got how they get during the teen years...weird! The first few years my school pictures came out pretty bad, so by the time I was in 10th Grade I was trying to take the worst photos possible (for fun of course!). Note that I even wore the same shirt every year!</a></p>
		<img src="HighSchoolChef.png" alt="High School Photos!" style="width:504px;height:362px; border="0">
		<p>High School was definitely a lot of fun though, and some of my favorite memories were playing volleyball with the other members of "Phelps' Wolf-Pac"!</a></p>

		<img src="chasevolleyball.jpg" alt="Chase Playing Volleyball" style="width:262px;height:304px; border="0">
		<p>High School doesn't last forever though, and while I was sad to see it end (and afraid about what was going to happen next) I kept moving ahead as I ascended into "The College Years"!</a></p>
		<img src="chasegraduation.JPG" alt="Chase Graduating High School" style="width:304px;height:262px; border="0">
		<center><h2>Mr. Floyd's College Years</a></h2></center>
		<p>I attended Temple University, and I entered the university undecided as to which career path to choose. I knew I was interested in many things though, such as exploring the city!</p> 													     
		<img src="collegechase1.JPG" alt="Chase in College" style="width:262px;height:304px; border="0">

		<img src="collegechase6.jpg" alt="Chase finding the City Gorilla!" style="width:304px;height:262px; border="0">
		<p>Towards the end of my senior year of high school though I became interested in music and the idea of challenging myself to learn, experience, and do new things "just for the sake of it". I had spent months working to learn how to play the piano, and not only did this lead to improving skills but it also led to discovering a passion for videography. "ChaseFloydInc" was thus born!</a></p>

		<img src="cfimusic.png" alt="Chase Floyd Inc is Born...with MUSIC!" style="width:404px;height:362px; border="0">
		<p>CFI was more or less my main focus for my first two years of college, and the things I accomplished, created, and set-in-motion turned this period of time into a renaissance of sorts in my life. The "100 Challenge" tops the list to this very day, and it is the main focus of my non-teaching life!</p>

		<img src="100challenge.PNG" alt="Chase's 100 Challenge!" style="width:304px;height:262px; border="0">
		<p>Time was ticking on my college-clock though, but it wasn't until the start of my junior year that I figured out what I wanted to do. After getting a new part-time job the previous summer my eyes were opened a bit, and I realized that I wanted to pursue becoming a science teacher. Science had ALWAYS been my favorite subject, and it aligned with many of my other life-goals such as wanting to improve my math skills, perform scientific research, and help others!</p> 
		<img src="chasescience.JPG" alt="Chase loved science from a very young age!" style="width:262px;height:304px; border="0">
		<p>I thus promptly changed my major at the start of the Fall semester that year, and a few months after that I was already at work in the classroom!</p> 
		<img src="mrfloyd1.png" alt="Mr. Floyd is Born!" style="width:304px;height:262px; border="0">
		<p>As I studied more and more science, my love for everything about it only grew ten-fold. I became obsessed with acquiring more knowledge and skills, and the final few years I spent in college were consumed with homework, studying, and reading about science. My final project, building a FOOD COMPUTER proved to be the perfect ending to a challenging and memorable couple of years!</p>
