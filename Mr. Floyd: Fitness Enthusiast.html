				<center><h2>Young Chase on the Fitness Trail!</h2></center>
				<p>As one of my idols, the one and only Jack Lalane, once said; "Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. Put them together and you've got a kingdom!" I couldn't agree more, and from a young age wisdom like this has guided me to consistently exercise and have an interest in my health and wellness! I feel that exercise and nutrition, along with the desire to keep growing, achieving, and improving in all facets of life via learning, doing, and experiencing new things is crucial to leading a happy and fulfilling life. I have thus created this page to share my adventures in fitness and health with the world, while also documenting my personal-bests to act as further motivation for myself whenever I train!</a></p>
				<center><h2>Early Beginnings in Exercise</h2></center>
				<p>My exploits into the world of fitness and exercising ironically began at the behest of my sister, Caitlin. Prior to playing a year of Little League Baseball (during which I had the hit of a lifetime, but that is a story for another day!), I suppose she deemed my fitness needed a boost. Modeling herself after a personal fitness trainer, she thus started up "Caitlin's", in which I was the first (and only!) proud membership card holder!</p>
				<img src="CaitlinsMembershipCard.jpg" alt="Caitlin's Exercise Pass Membership Card!" style="width:539px;height:481px; border="0">
				<p>I remember doing a lot of sit-ups, running/sprinting, push-ups, and other random things such as balancing and general sports activities while enrolled at "Caitlin's". This was my very first experience with organized physical fitness though, and it would remain that way until my very early teenage years...</p>
				<center><h2>Fitness Takes Off</h2></center>
				<p>Aside from my time at "Caitlin's" and playing youth sports, growing up fitness was not the major component of my life that it is today. It was still a component though, albeit a minor one, and I remember every year or so I'd start doing basic exercises again in preparation for the Physical Education President's Challenge Fitness Awards (aka the gym class physical fitness tests!). I am very competitive, and my competitiveness would display itself often during these competitions since I wanted to always do the very best that I could. One could argue that I am a rather average natural athelete though (:P), so to do well on these I always had to work harder than others in order to compete.</p>
								    <p>There are two categories of achievement for these tests, "Presidential" and "National", with the former being the highest possible ranking. To obtain these awards though one has to get "Presidential" or "National" in EVERY physical fitness event, and this proved to be quite the challenge to a young Chase Floyd. Throughout elementary school and into junior high I had good speed, so the shuttle run was something I could usually get at least National in. The mile was manageable, despite my lack of direct training, sit-ups were a breeze, but the two main things that always prevent me fro earning the award were the v-sit and the dreaded pull-up. My failure to do the latter was on full display during my 9th grade test, which if I recall was around mid-Spring, in which I could do 0 reps. This was infront of my class of 9th and 10th graders, many of them good atheletes, and I not only felt embarassed but ashamed at how I let myself be so weak.</p>
								    <p>I lacked the upper-body strength to do even one measly pull-up. I also had zero. Zilch. NADA flexibility in my hamstrings growing up. These two things (the v-sit and pull-ups) always got in my way when it came to earning the award, and it wasn't until my freshman year (9th grade) that I had enough and became determined to overcome this. I had been developing my own basic workout plans for years, but it was time to take things to the next level. My dad helped me to get some weights/machines, a stretching mat, and to build a pull-up bar to get me going, but it would be up to me to utilize my newfound fitness environment. And utilize it I did...</p>
								    <p>I became determined...obsessed, if you will, with improving my physical fitness from this point onward. I wanted to be big and strong like the "American Gladiators". I wanted to have no weaknesses in my form. But more than anything else, I wanted to EARN that award. So I began training to directly address these flaws, and I started with the flexbility. I could not even come close to touching my toes, but one day I just had enough and I grabbed on to them for dear life! The pain...the discomfort...it was real! But it also felt really...really good. Before I knew it, something just changed in my legs and my flexbility improved drastically. That next year, 10th grade, I easily got over 9 inches in the v-sit and earned presidential for the first time.</p>
								    <p>Pull-ups were a bit more difficult to master, since they are the kind of exercise that you can either do or not do. Fortunately the machine my father had gotten for me had a lat pull-down station, and I used this to begin building up the strength in my back needed to be able to do pull-ups. It took a few months, but eventually I was able to do my first REAL pull-up. Once I could do one, I couldn't get enough! I was doing pull-ups as often as I could, and as much as I could, for I was determined to make things different the next time I had the chance to do them infront of my class...</p>
