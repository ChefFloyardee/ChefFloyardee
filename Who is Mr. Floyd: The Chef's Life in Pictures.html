			<p>As I sit here and write this, I find myself at a crossroads of sorts in my life. The year is 2020, and for some reason I feel the need to begin writing an "autobiography" of sorts for myself, despite the fact that there are A LOT of things I not only PLAN to do but WILL do before my life is completed! Part of this stems from the year 2020 itself, a year in which my own mortality has suddenly become far more apparent than it ever had been before. Despite what you may be thinking, this is not due to the Coronavirus though. You see, for me the year 2020 has featured an absolute EXPLOSION of filming and creating videos for ChaseFloydInc. 2020 has been a long awaited return to maximum productivity, at least as far as filming is concerned, coincided with the true arrival (at long last!) of the prophesied 2nd Renaissance of CFI!</p>

			<p>Much of what I have done this year had been long overdue, put off for years due to a variety of reasons, but nevertheless it is finally getting done. All of the filming of myself has led me to have to look at myself quite a bit though, a process which revealed that I look "different" than I used to. Perhaps it is wisdom that has changed my appearance, something that can only be gained by living a bit of life! Whatever the cause, I do look different, and as I go through the hours of footage part of me wants to see a different version of myself on the screen. I am who I am though, but at the same time I want to be who I was...</p>
			<img src="CHEF FLOYARDEE - CLEAN.png" alt="CHEF FLOYARDEE" title="CHEF FLOYARDEE">
			<p>I don't want dwell on the past and not become who I will become though as well, but I do want to get this literal TON of 2020 footage edited and released. This current version of myself is having difficulty doing this though since perfection in the present remains my greatest foe. Perfection in the present, to a degree, can be achieved and this has led me to FILM and RE-FILM just about everything like crazy. Perfection in the past cannot be obtained though, since what was is just that, what was. This line of thought has led me to go through all of my old videos and pictures with the goal of finding material to create content from that I cannot go back and change. So I am going to do just that, slowly but surely working my way through the years up to the present. Perhaps this process will be "cathartic", and upon its completion I will be ready to tackle 2020's footage. Either that, or by the time I get there it won't be 2020 anymore!</p>
			<img src="CHEF FLOYARDEE - CLEAN.png" alt="CHEF FLOYARDEE" title="CHEF FLOYARDEE">
			<p>I am thus going to begin this process right here on my website, by making more webpages featuring my "blog-style" writings. I don't have much choice in the matter though, since if I am going to do this from the very start all of the "content" I have to work with will just be pictures anyways so it's not like I can even start by making more videos for CFI (or could I...hmm....)! SO! Let's start this process of content creating with this page, which will be the first of many "year-by-year" webpages designed to act as an "autobiography" of sorts, beginning with very beginning; the year of my birth!</p>

			<p>NOTE! My "The Life & Times of Floyd" page will remain on my website, since this acts as a great little "mini-biograpgy" for me! Here is a link to it below for anyone who wants a far more brief analysis of The Chef's life!</p>
