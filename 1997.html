				<p>I AM BACK! I CAN DO THIS! GO GO GO CHEF GO! YES YES YES YES! I WILL WIN! I FEEL GREAT! I CAN DO THIS! ERRRRGGGHHHHHHH!!!!</p>

        <p>Yeah....so it has been 3 MONTHS since I last worked on these pages, but I promise you that I have a good reason for this hiatus! The most important and RARE picture(s) that will be included on this page DID NOT EXIST (sorta!) until a few weeks ago! You're probably wondering how this could be possible, since these pages mainly contain photos taken during the year they correlate to, but stay with me! These photos (the two most notable being above and below this text!) were LOST to time in the many, many, many, many layers of STUFF located at 1193 Floydfield USA, but around last May or so I found these NEGATIVES while excavating one corner of my house which (by some MIRACLE) contained these INCREDIBLY RARE photos from 1997 that will form the CRUX of the INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT "ChaseFloydInc Foundational Story" on this PAGE!</p>
				    <img src="LOST97NEGATIVES!.jpg" alt="THE LOST 97 NEGATIVES! YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COST TO GET DEVELOPED!" title="THE LOST 97 NEGATIVES! YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH THEY COST TO GET DEVELOPED!" style="width:262px;height:304px; border=" 0"="">
		<p>After all of that HYPE you are probably wondering just what this INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT "ChaseFloydInc Foundational Story" IS, and as always THE CHEF does not intend to DISAPPOINT his audience during the TELLING OF IT! Well, it is actually quite simple. These two pictures hold A LOT of little details that I will go over in great detail, but the main thing you will likely notice is that I have VASELINE all over my FACE! Now before you go running away in fear of where this story is going, allow me to EXPLAIN all that you need to KNOW!</p>

		<p>I am a complex being. Anyone who knows me would have to agree with that $ci Fact! Throughout my life though my "complexities", as we shall call them, have led me to having several different "<i>somethings</i>" that I have had to deal with. In fact, as I sit here and WRITE this I am dealing with a handful of these RIGHT NOW! What do I mean by this term "<i>somethings</i>" though, you ask? Well, how can I put this in a way that makes me not seem like I am secretly CRAZY IN THE HEAD...? Hmmmm....</p>
			<p>I have never been diagnosed with anything "in the head", and in all honesty EVERYONE is probably little screwy up there! But throughout my life I have had several, one after the other, "obsessive compulsive behaviors" manifest themselves with great frequency in my daily life.
