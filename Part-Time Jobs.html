				<h2>Weis Markets</h2>
				<p>Teaching is and always will be my main love when it comes to profession, but I have had some some part-time jobs in my life as well. Aside from working with my father a bit, the main part-time job that I had was at Weis Markets. I worked there for over half a decade, starting when I was still in college. I am the kind of person who tends to stick with something though, so despite the many ups and downs of being part-time in a grocery store I look back fondly on the many long days I spent at Weis Markets Store #165...</a></p>

        <p>I moved to Northeast PA when I was 5 years old, and one of the first places my family went to shop for groveries was this little store called "Mr. Z's" in a town called Waverly. This store had a great charm, and it looked like a place straight out of the 50s. Growing up we would go there all of the time, with trips occurring weekly after our Sunday fleamarket adventures in most cases. I vividly remember liking the feel of this store, since it seemed so old and nostalgic. Mr. Z's was owned by a larger store called "Weis Markets", so they also had the great "Weis Kids Club" featuring an anthropomorphic cow (Bo) and bird (Opal), which made the place seem even more inviting. My sister and I were club members, and we were thus able to get a lot of free cookies, pencil cases, cards, and (in my sister's case) Little Blue Hugs!</p>

        <p>As I got older, I started to feel like it was "lame" to go shopping at the grocery store with my parents, so for a couple of years I did not enter this store. The memories about it began to fade as well, while many of my peers began working there during our high school years making a visit an expedition in the awkward. The store's name also changed during these years from "Mr. Z's" to "Weis Markets". Weis Markets was a larger grocery store chain based out of Sunbury, PA that had been slowly expanding for years by buying up smaller chains. They bought many chains, such as IGA, Mr. Z's, and even Kings (which was a store that I ironically went to a lot before moving to Northeast PA from Southeast PA during my very early years).</p>

        <p>Around my Sophmore Year of College, my sister (who had been working here for almost 3 years) encouraged me to get a job at Weis. I had not stepped foot into that store for almost ten years, but upon doing so I quickly realized that nothing about it had changed. I liked this, and I also liked the work. There was always something to do, and being the fitness enthusiast that I am all of the work felt like light exercise to me so I enjoyed this aspect as well. The number one thing I enjoyed though was all of the old music that played on the radio. Mostly from the 80s, from the start I found this to just be the coolest thing; Working while listening to music!</p>

        <p>In a way, getting a job at a grocery store was a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Growing up I remember making up this story for a school project that I was reincarnated from a man named "Nate Johnson" who died a few years or so before I was born. Nate Johnson was the manager at a Shop-Rite in a wooded area near Camden, New Jersey. A bizarre story, yes, but in a way slightly predicative of future events. Stores, mainly grocery stores and malls, always fascinated me though so working in one definitely felt quite natural. Some of my favorite stores growing up were Shop-Rite, Clemens, Kings, Lane-Co, K-Mart, and of course Mr. Z's!</p>
	<img src="Stores.png" alt="Some Stores I Always Liked!" style="width:262px;height:304px; border="0">
        <p>My Weis career thus got off to a very good start, and I found myself to be a natural on the job. My primary jobs were as a grocery stock-clerk and the third-shift produce department associate. I was THE FASTEST stock-person around, earning the nickname "MVP" for my efforts. I was also a BEAST over in the duce, shucking corn and putting away the order like a champ. These early times at Weis were good, but the repetitiveness of the job quickly made me realize that I had to get my act together at college to someday find something more rewarding.</p>

        <p>My Weis career was far from over though, and many more years of Weis-action would come and go. Hours and days would change, my duties would increase as I slowly learned how to use CGO and the registers, but more notably than that the people would vary. Old co-workers would leave, new ones would arrive, and slowly but surely I became a veteran in the store. I also changed a lot as a worker over the years, going through various phases such as the "dead-legs" era, the "rotation and routine" dynasty, and even the re-birth into a smarter version of the MVP. Throughout it all though I stood strong, making some GREAT friends and meeting a TON of great customers. I even got to lead a couple "Mystery Tour" field trips reminiscent of "Carmen San Diego" video games (just in a grocery store), along with getting to be one of the only people from our store to ever get to drive the "Weis Van".</p>

        <p>Working at a grocery store is tough, but it can be rewarding. A well-run one though knows when and how to have fun, and I assure you that I had my fair share of fun in that store. Halloween was always one of my favorite days in the store, since we got to dress-up. I always dressed up as "Weis-Man", a super-hero who doubled as a seemingly normal grocery stock clerk. Fueled with the power of the "Weis Power Amulet", a magic talisman that gives him the ability to transform instantly from "Chaz Lloyd" into "The Mad Grocer", and supported by his sidekick "Gibralter the Cow", Weis-Man would go on to inspire a science-focused story I wrote for my students called "The Mad Grocer".</p>

        <p>I will miss a lot of things about working in Weis Markets, from its old style charm to its wonderful cast of people. One thing that cannot be replicated though is the "Gem Hunting" we would do in the store. "Gem Hunting" in this sense means hunting for old tags, coupons, stickers, etc. lost beneath the store's shelves and various structures. What a blast one can have searching for these hidden treasures and then re-hiding them in "the vault"; it even beats pulling out of dates!</p>

			<h2>June</h2>
			<p>I guess what I will miss most about Weis though is the people. From the employees to the customers, this store was simply FILLED to the brim with an all-star cast of good people. I learned A LOT about life from them, and the many life-lessons on how to be a good person they shared with me is probably the most valuable thing I obtained from working here. One person in particular stands out though, and that person is none other than our #1 all-time customer; June.</p>
			<img src="JuneKowtkoAutograph.jpg" alt="June's Autograph!" style="width:304px;height:262px; border="0">
			<p>The above signature is from June Kowtko, an older woman who visited the store literally every day. I wish I had a picture with her, and while I once asked her for one she declined so I had to respect that. Regardless, this is just as good though and I am super glad I have it! Anywho, June was not only the number one customer in number but also in our hearts. I developed a very special friendship with her, and I would often have very long conversations with her in the pet food aisle. I suppose we bonded a lot during our run-ins while in this aisle, which were frequent since I enjoyed working that aisle's freight and she had to go there daily to get food for the many cats, dogs, and other stray animals she would take care off. June had a heart of Au (this "typo" will make sense momentarily), for she cared for many animals that no one else batted an eye for. She would also often get emotional when sharing her stories of hardship whenever one of her animals got hurt, which showed to me how much her care for them impacted her.</p>

			<p>When I started working at Weis, how I viewed other people upon first meeting them was still in an immature stage. I remember first meeting June and passing off judgement on her as being "just another cat lady". I also thought it was annoying how she would park on the side of the store and leave her cart there. I hated getting carts, so this drove me mad. How unbelievably wrong and pig-minded I was though. As time passed I began to learn more and more about June, and I also even began learning from her. She was actually a SCIENTIST, a retired Chemist who had worked for years in a New Jersey company called "Hoffmann-La Roche". This company focused on pharmaceuticals, and she was one of the lead chemists in their lab. When I found this out, that June was actually a REAL scientist (she even has PUBLISHED and CITED works, just look below, and she even SIGNED one of them for me!), it totally opened up my eyes to how much of a fool I had been to pass judgement on her based off of her appearance. Not only her, but on everyone I had ever met. It really is true when they say to never judge a book by its cover!</p>

			<p>June and I bonded even more once I had found out about our shared loved of Science, and this formed the basis for many of our future discussions. I remember one day, in the pet food aisle, we were discussing chemical reactions and it led to us working out a few balancing problems on a Friskies cat-food can tray. Due to this and her overall personality, as the years went by June became one of my favorite people to see at Weis. June's positivity was so powerful that even my mindset for getting carts changed! I began to enjoy walking over to the side of the store to get her sacred heart (woops, I meant cart!...or did I!) after she left, and it made me begin to think that maybe there was even more to June. I remember thinking (heck, I still do!) that maybe June was actually a guardian angel of sorts sent here to make me a better person. Maybe this long walk she'd make me have to take to get her cart was a higher power's way of getting me to think and reflect about <i>people</i> other than myself for a moment each day. Ya know what...to heck with all of the maybes! I totally KNOW that this was the case!</p>
