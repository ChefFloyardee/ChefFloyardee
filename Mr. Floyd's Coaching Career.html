				<p>One of the reasons I became a teacher was to have the opportunity to coach and mentor people who were looking to improve themselves, learn how to do something better, and/or partake in competition and sport! I have many, many interests and hobbies, so I feel that I am a good fit for this role and I am thus always actively looking for more ways to get involved (especially in sports, which I have yet to do, but this is tops on my list!)! I have thus dedicated this page to all of the extracurricular things I have been a part of thus far!</a></p>
        <center><h2>2018-2019 K'NEX STEM Design Challenge</h2></center>
			<p>During the 2018-2019 School Year I was the coach of one of two 8th Grade K'NEX STEM Design Challenge Teams. This competition requires students to build a K'NEX machine that can accomplish a given task (this particular year's task was to pick up an object and move it 6 inches across a table), while also developing blueprints, a journal, and a presentation related to their design. I had an absolute BLAST helping my team of students develop their project, which we called "Jerome" (Jerome the Cyber-Turtle, to be exact)! Jerome utilized this EPIC "double-motor" design that allowed his "lift arm" to move back and forth. Jerome was also an amputee but he became a solar-powered, trash-picking up cyber-turtle, and yes, Jerome ended up looking just as awesome as this sounds! </a></p>
