			<center><h1>Mr. Floyd's Pets</h1></center>
			<center>
				<p>I am an unabashed animal LOVER, and I respect all life immensely; (Yes, contrary to what some people think hunters can and usually are of this mindset). I have thus had several pets over the course of my life, and each one of these furry/scaly/feathered little beasts has acted to bring A LOT of positivity into my life!</a></p>
        <h2>Chuckie and Chi-Chi</h2>
        <p>If I recall correctly, the first two pets I ever had were these two parakeets named "Chuckie and Chi-Chi". One was blue, and one was green (I forget which was which). How my family got these birds is a bit of a story, since I am pretty sure my father just brought these two birds home one day and gave them to my mother to take care of. I was probably around 3 years old when we got these, so I do not remember that much about them, but I do recall looking at them in their cage located in our basement quite often with wonderment. Thinking back to this as an adult always makes me say to myself "Huh...so we totally had birds...why again did we have them?", while also making sure to note that this is a classic example of a "pocket-in-time" event!</p>
        <h2>Cutter and Cheyenne</h2>
        <p>The next main pets that we had were Cutter and Cheyenne. Cutter was a yellow lab, and Cheyenne was a chocolate lab. They were brother and sister, and we acquired them from a family in Lancaster. I remember meeting two members of this family's children, since they were the same age as myself and my sister, and finding it awesome when they said that their names were "Boy-ie" and "Girl-ie". Boyie and Girle were super nice though, and they gave my sister and I a purple and orange stuffed bunny (two items that were lost due to terrible inaction on my part, but this is a story for another day...). Any who, aside from briefly having a black lab named "Blackie" before I was born, Cutter and Cheyenne were my family's first real dogs. We absolutely loved and adored them from day one. Cutter was a bit of a chunker, but he was so nice and friendly. Cheyenne was much slimmer and fast like lightning, and while she could be a bit sneaky she made up for it with all of the love she'd give!</p>
        <h2>William</h2>
        <p>Cutter lived until he was 10 years old, leaving us just with Cheyenne for a few years. It was so, so sad when we had to put Cutter to rest. This was another "pocket-in-time" day, but one far more sad. My sister encouraged us to get another pet though, specifically a cat, to keep Cheyenne company. We henceforth adopted this little farm kitten from Bradford County, originally naming the little orange and white mush-ball "Cyber" to keep our trend of "C" names going. I thought that he looked more like a "William" though, so before long we all started calling him that. Will was a bit of a meanie at first though, since he would often jump on Cheyenne (who now possessed the nickname "Cjoe", pronounced "Jo", due to my desire for all of our pets to have common human names) and scratch her. Will and Cheyenne lived together for about three or so years, with the latter showing the former the ropes. William eventually calmed down and the pair became good friends due to all of their time spent together. Cheyenne would eventually pass on though at age 13, on a warm Summer day in my arms, after she started convulsing the prior night. This was another very, very sad moment...one that I will never forget...</p> 
        <h2>The Chickens</h2>
        <p>William remained our only pet for many years following Cheyenne's passing, and he slowly but surely became a fixture in our home. He was always fun to play with, a decent snuggler for a cat, but not afraid to claw you up if he felt like it. The more pets the better though, so one day my father went and got 8 fertilized chicken eggs from Tractor Supply in order to "hatch" some new animal friends. A few days after putting the eggs under a heat lamp to incubate, they finally hatched. Eight little baby chicks! My father also built a really nice coop for all of them, so once they were big enough that is where they were to live. Only 7 of the 8 survived long enough for the big transfer though, but these 7 managed to live for many years in that pen. We had eggs out the WAH-ZOO during these years, and the daily routine of feeding, egg collecting, and "walking" the chickens became quite enjoyable. One day though some predatory animal, likely one of the foxes we'd see running around, got in the coop and took out one of our chickens. Despite good efforts, over the next couple of years more predators would sneak in from time to time, and one by one our chickens fell prey to these wild beasts...</p>
