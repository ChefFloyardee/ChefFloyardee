				<p>Two pages down!! Woo!! Let's keep going, but before I go AHEAD I must go BACK just a bit!!! I did not mention the house I was born in and initially grew up in at all in the previous two pages, which is something that just CANNOT be allowed to happen if telling the STORY of my LIFE (WOAH! That was A LOT of ALL CAPS!)! This was intentional though since my MEMORIES did not really begin to form until 1995 or so, and my MEMORIES around this time mainly took place in this HOUSE!</p>

				<p>The house in the above picture is this house and it has thus always been known to me as my "Old House" since it was the first house I ever lived in. My family moved into this house, located at 1871, Taylor Drive, Center Valley, Lehigh County, PA just before I was born. Prior to this my Father, Mother, and Sister lived in a small trailer next to my Paternal Grandmother's house in the town of Trumbauersville, which is located just outside of Quakertown (Bucks County, PA). The arrival of another "Bundle of Floyd" meant more space was needed though (yes, this was a reference to me being a MASSIVE BABY!), so the cross county move was meant to accomodate this!</p>

				<p>All of my earliest memories are obviously from this house, its yard, and the surrounding areas I visited while growing up. This house thus holds a very special place in my heart. We would eventually move from this house in June of 1998 with the goal of obtaining more land though, and despite my fondness for this house and the memories I have there I have yet to return. This has been intentional though, since I do not want my memories to be "tainted" at all. The entire "Allentown Area", which as far as I am concenred includes all of Bucks and Lehigh County, has changed A LOT over the years mainly due to an increasing population in relatively nearby Philadelphia. I thus imagine all of the places I remember, such as the EPIC Hellertown Park and Pool, the LANE-CO & Kings Shopping Center, the BLUE STORE, the BARBELL Area, the DQ, the CARP PONDS, the DINO-SPONGE BROWN BUILDING, and others have changed so much that it just would not be the same. I guess what I am trying to say is that sometimes it truly is better to just leave certain things in the past if you want them to remain the way you remember them...!</p>
